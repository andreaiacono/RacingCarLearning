#Reinforcement Learning Experiments

This repo contains the simulator of a circuit for car racing and various RL techiniques.

TODO:
- add Q-Learning and Policy Gradients
- check on real image or low depth image (4 bit)
- add side skid effect
- instead of images, give RL a state (position + direction + speed)

rewards: onTrack, checkpoints, speed, laptime!
